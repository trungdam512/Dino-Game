# Project Description
Our project simulates the Dinosaur Game, or Chrome Dino, that is built into the Google Chrome web browser, which was originally created by the Chrome UX team in 2014. The player's goal is to guide a Tyrannosaurus rex across a moving landscape, avoiding as many obstacles as possible to achieve a high score.
# Instructions
To play the game, users would need to have a Python IDE and the pygame module installed. After the module has been set up, users can click the Run button to initiate the program. When the program is first opened, a start screen featuring a dinosaur on a black background would be displayed on the screen. To start playing, users can press either the Space or the ↑ button on the keyboard.

Players would use the Space, ↑, and ↓ buttons on the keyboard to instruct a Tyrannosaurus to jump or duck accordingly in order to avoid obstacles on its track. After ducking (after the ↓ button is pressed), either the Space or the ↑ button needs to be pressed in order to change the Dinosaur back to its standing state.

There are two types of Obstacles: cacti and birds. To avoid colliding with the cacti, users should press the Space or ↑ button to make the Dinosaur jump over the cacti. On the contrary, if the obstacle is a bird, users should press the ↓ button to instruct the Dinosaur to duck under.

The longer the user plays, the higher their scores would be. The game ends when the Dinosaur crashes into an obstacle. At which point, the user can either quit the game by clicking the X square button in the top right corner of the game screen, or restart the game by pressing the Space button. In the latter case, the program would return back to the start screen.
